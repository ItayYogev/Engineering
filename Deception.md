# Deception in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)

Deception is a feature in **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)**, akin to a honeypot, designed to mislead and trap attackers. There are three main components of this feature:

1. **Decoys**: Fake assets that can include specific users or computers.
2. **Lures**: Deceptive findings that guide attackers to the decoys. This may encompass credentials or fake network diagrams embedded within the organizationâ€™s computers.
3. **Deployment and Management**: The process of deploying decoys and lures through MDE. Implementation varies by organization based on machine learning analysis, helping to determine optimal placement.
